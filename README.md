Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

A relational database system (e.g., MySQL)

Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmployeePaySlipProject.git
Open in Your IDE

Launch your IDE.

Import the project folder as a Java project.

Set Up Database Connection

Open DatabaseConnection.java (in the dbconnection package).

Update the database URL, username, and password with your credentials.

Build the Project

Ensure the JRE System Library is set to JavaSE-17.
To set up a JDBC driver for database connectivity, follow these steps:

1. Download the JDBC Driver
Identify the database you're using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).

Visit the official website of your database provider and download the corresponding JDBC driver (usually a .jar file).

2. Add the Driver to Your Project
If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse:

Right-click on your project and go to Build Path > Add External JARs.

Select the downloaded .jar file and add it to your project.

If you're using a command-line setup:

Place the .jar file in your project directory.

Add it to your classpath when compiling and running your Java program:

bash
javac -cp .:path/to/jdbc-driver.jar YourProgram.java
java -cp .:path/to/jdbc-driver.jar YourProgram


Use your IDE's build tool to compile the project.

Running the Application
Locate Main.java in the App package.

Right-click and select “Run” (or use your IDE’s run configuration).

Usage
Manage employee records.

Generate pay slips and GST records.

Handle database connections and exceptions seamlessly.

1. Installation of MySQL Workbench
Download MySQL Workbench:

Visit the official MySQL Workbench download page and choose the version compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Install MySQL Workbench:

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

During installation, ensure you also install the MySQL Server if it's not already installed.

Set Up MySQL Server:

Configure the MySQL Server with a root password and other settings during installation.

2. Setting Up MySQL Workbench for Your Project
Launch MySQL Workbench:

Open the application and connect to your MySQL Server using the root credentials.

Create a New Database:

Go to the "Database" menu and select "Create Schema."

Name your database (e.g., EmployeePaySlipDB) and click "Apply."

Import or Create Tables:

Use the SQL Editor to create tables for your project (e.g., Employee, PaySlip, GSTRecord).

Example SQL for creating an Employee table:

sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Designation VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
Test Queries:

Use the SQL Editor to test queries and ensure your database is functioning as expected.

3. Integrating MySQL Workbench with Your Java Project
Database Connection:

Use the JDBC driver to connect your Java application to the MySQL database.

Update the DatabaseConnection.java file in your project with the database URL, username, and password.

Run Your Application:

Ensure your Java application interacts with the database correctly by running it and testing features like employee record management and pay slip generation.
